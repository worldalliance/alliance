    category: "Climate Change",
    body: `Protect Ecuador's Biodiversity Hotspot

## The Crisis
Gold mining companies are expressing interest in a highly biodiverse area of Ecuador's cloud forest. This pristine ecosystem is home to countless species of plants, animals, and insects found nowhere else on Earth.

## Our Solution
We can outpace these mining companies by purchasing the land directly and placing it under permanent protection. Every dollar donated goes directly toward land acquisition and legal protection.

## Impact
- **2,500 acres** of pristine cloud forest protected
- **Hundreds of species** safeguarded from extinction
- **Carbon sequestration** equivalent to taking 1,000 cars off the road
- **Indigenous rights** protected and respected

## How It Works
1. We identify critical parcels of land under threat
2. Local partners negotiate with landowners
3. Legal protections are put in place
4. Long-term stewardship is established

This is our chance to take direct action against environmental destruction. Every contribution makes a difference.`,

## The Challenge
Over 200 rural schools in Kenya lack reliable electricity, forcing students to study by candlelight and limiting their access to modern educational resources.

- **Climate benefits** from clean energy adoption

## Your Contribution
- **$25** - Powers LED lights for one classroom
- **$100** - Provides tablet charging station
- **$500** - Funds complete solar system for one school

Every dollar directly funds equipment and installation. Local technicians are trained to maintain the systems, creating sustainable job opportunities.

    body: `Target the Problem at Its Source

## The Issue
Target stocks millions of single-use plastic bottles from Coca-Cola every year. These bottles contribute to ocean pollution, landfill waste, and microplastic contamination in our food chain.

## Why Target?
As one of America's largest retailers, Target has the power to influence supplier practices. When major retailers take a stand, companies like Coca-Cola are forced to change.

## Previous Successes
- **Walmart** successfully pressured suppliers to reduce packaging waste
- **Whole Foods** banned plastic bags, leading to industry-wide changes
- **European retailers** have already begun phasing out single-use plastics

## Our Strategy
We'll contact Target's corporate headquarters and local stores to demand they stop stocking Coca-Cola single-use plastic bottles. With enough pressure, they'll have to listen.

## What Happens Next
When Target removes these products, it sends a clear message to Coca-Cola and other companies that single-use plastics are no longer acceptable. This creates a domino effect across the industry.

Your voice matters. Let's make it heard.`,

## The Green New Deal
The Green New Deal is comprehensive legislation that would:
- Transition the US to 100% clean energy by 2030
- Create millions of good-paying union jobs
- Invest in frontline communities most affected by climate change
- Upgrade our infrastructure for the 21st century

## Why Your Representative Matters
Congressional representatives respond to constituent pressure. When they hear from voters in their district, they pay attention. Your voice can influence their vote on this crucial legislation.

## Current Status
The Green New Deal has support from over 100 House members and 14 senators, but we need more representatives to sign on. Your call could be the one that tips the balance.

## What Others Are Saying
*"The Green New Deal is the most comprehensive climate plan ever proposed in Congress."* - Environmental Defense Fund

*"This legislation would create jobs while solving the climate crisis."* - AFL-CIO

## The Urgency
Climate scientists warn we have less than a decade to make dramatic changes to avoid catastrophic warming. The Green New Deal provides the bold action we need.

### Step 1: Find Your Representative
Visit **congress.gov** and enter your zip code to find your representative's contact information.

### Step 2: Call Their Office
Most representatives have both DC and local offices. Try the local office first - they're often more responsive to constituents.

### Step 3: Use This Script
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], a constituent from [Your City]. I'm calling to urge Representative [Name] to cosponsor the Green New Deal. Climate change is an urgent threat, and we need bold action now. Will the Representative support this legislation?"

### Step 4: Ask Follow-Up Questions

- "Will they meet with constituents about this issue?"
- "When can we expect a response?"

### Step 5: Document Your Call
- Note the staff person's name
- Record their response
- Ask for a written follow-up

### If You Get Voicemail
Leave a clear message with your name, city, and request. Staff members track constituent calls and report them to the representative.

    body: `Hit Them Where It Hurts: Their Profits

## The Coca-Cola Problem
Coca-Cola is one of the world's worst plastic polluters:
- **3 million tons** of plastic packaging per year
- **200,000 bottles** sold every minute
- **No. 1 plastic polluter** in global beach cleanups for 4 years running

## Why Boycotts Work
Corporate boycotts have a proven track record:
- **Montgomery Bus Boycott** ended segregation on public transportation
- **Nestle boycott** changed infant formula marketing practices
- **Apartheid boycotts** helped end South African apartheid

## The Economic Impact
When consumers change their purchasing habits:
- **Stock prices** reflect consumer sentiment
- **Revenue decline** forces policy changes
- **Brand reputation** suffers, leading to quick action

## Alternatives to Try
Instead of Coca-Cola products, choose:
- **Local craft sodas** made with natural ingredients
- **Sparkling water** with fruit flavors
- **Homemade drinks** using fresh ingredients
- **Reusable bottles** filled with tap water

## Beyond Personal Choice
This boycott is about sending a message: companies must take responsibility for their environmental impact. Your individual choice, multiplied by thousands of others, creates real change.

## The Bigger Picture
While we boycott, we're also pressuring retailers to drop Coca-Cola products and lobbying for legislation to hold companies accountable for plastic waste.
